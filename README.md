The provided Python code implements a simple chatbot with basic functionality and user interaction. The core functionality is encapsulated within the `Chatbot` class, which is responsible for handling greetings, farewells, questions, and responses. Upon initialization, the chatbot sets up lists of greetings and farewells, as well as dictionaries mapping questions to their corresponding responses. These responses include both informative and humorous answers to engage users. The `greet()` method randomly selects a greeting message to welcome the user, while the `farewell()` method selects a farewell message when the user decides to exit the conversation.

The `respond_to_basic_questions()` method allows the chatbot to answer predefined questions by matching the user's input to the questions stored in the dictionary. If the input matches a known question, a random response associated with that question is selected and returned. Otherwise, a default error message is displayed. The `ask_question()` method prompts the user with a question and waits for their response. This facilitates the chatbot's interaction with the user. Additionally, the `ask_user()` method orchestrates a simple conversation flow by asking the user a series of predefined questions and responding accordingly.

In the main function, `main()`, an instance of the `Chatbot` class is created, and the conversation begins with a greeting message. The user is then prompted to interact with the chatbot by asking questions or providing input. The conversation continues until the user decides to exit by typing 'bye'. Upon exiting, a farewell message is displayed, and the program terminates. Finally, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `main()` function is executed when the script is run directly, providing a convenient entry point for the chatbot application. Overall, this implementation provides a basic yet functional chatbot capable of engaging users in simple Q&A interactions.
